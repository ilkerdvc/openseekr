SEEKR: Simulation-Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates

Introduction
------------

OpenSEEKR is an extension of the SEEKR suit of open-source scripts and 
tools designed to enable researchers to perform multiscale computation of the 
kinetics of molecular binding, unbinding, and transport using a combination 
of molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and milestoning theory.

Instructions
------------

SEEKR is designed to be run on Linux. Obtain SEEKR by cloning the Git 
repository on github.


git clone https://github.com/lvotapka/openseekr.git

Or, go to the URL https://github.com/lvotapka/openseekr.git and click the "Clone 
or download" button and save to a place in your computer.

From there, open seekr/doc/manual.txt to get started.


SEEKR is designed to run on Linux and requires the installation of the 
following software to function properly:

 - OpenMM
 - BrownDye
 - LEaP (when using the Amber forcefield)
 - APBS

In addition to the following nonstandard Python libraries:
 - numpy
 - scipy

All these programs/libraries must be installed and functional before using 
SEEKR. Please consult the manuals for these programs/libraries for 
installation and usage instructions.

NOTE: This is a preliminary version of OpenSEEKR, and it is currently only
capable of performing spherical milestone SEEKR calculations up to the
umbrella stage.
